# Case Study

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Data Set

https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/

This dataset is provided from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) regarding consumer complaints related to financial products or services. The CFPB protects consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices and takes action against companies that break federal consumer financial laws such as the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

The dataset includes consumer complaints from 2019 regarding categorized products, the company the complaint is against, and resolution information.

Todays class will be a case study evaluating this data set. Our goal is to analyze 2019 complaints through visualizations to identify interesting relationships. Following our analysis further research can be done to determine if any trends identified relate to specific companies and could be indicative of underlying predatory financial practices.

To perform our analysis, we will be using the JavaScript library Plotly to visually explore and report on the data.

Additionally, we will be working with summary statistics of the dataset, but that the original data can be downloaded as a CSV at [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/).

### 1. Instructor Do: Submission Forms

* In this activity, our goal is to create a Plotly bar chart showing the relationship between the 6 different forms of submissions to the CFPB to determine utilization.

### 2. Student Do: Product Complaints

* To analyze our data we will create a Plotly bar chart to show the relationship between products with complaints submitted to the CFPB. This will help to determine which type of products are the most problematic.

### 3. Instructor Do: Monthly Complaints

* In this activity, our goal is to create a Plotly line chart showing the amount of complaints by month to determine if there is any specific time of year impacted more than others.

### 4. Student Do: Daily Complaints

* To analyze daily complaints we will create a Plotly line chart showing the amount of complaints by day to determine if there are any patterns worth exploring.

### 5. Instructor Do: Credit Card and Checking Complaints

* In this activity, our goal is to create multiple Plotly line charts breaking down the amount of complaints for Credit Card & Checking products by month to determine if either product is more prevelent at different times of year.

### 6. Student Do: Monthly Product Complaints

* To analyze product complaints by month we will create multiple Plotly line traces for each of the provided products by month.

### 7. Everyone Do: Complaints Bubbles

* In our final activity the goal is to take our previous multiple trace line chart and change it to a scatter plot. We will then turn our scatter plot into a Bubble Chart by sizing each marker based on the number of responses that were considered not timely.

### End

* Further analysis could now be done from today's work looking into the reported companies to determine if any of the trends relate to specific companies and could be indicative of underlying financial practices.
