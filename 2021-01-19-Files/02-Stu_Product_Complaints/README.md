![../../Images/bar2.png](../../Images/bar2.png)

* To analyze our data we will create a Plotly bar chart to show the relationship between products with complaints submitted to the CFPB. This will help to determine which type of products are the most problematic.

* Import the data from the [Resources](/Resources/) folder and perfom the following steps:

    - Create a bar chart trace

    - Create the data array for the plot

    - Define the plot layout

    - Plot the chart to a div tag with id "plot"

* Bonus: Turn the chart into a horizontal bar chart.
